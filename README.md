# Developing a Sensory Experience Lexicon for the Hotel Industry Based on Online Reviews

This study explores how word embedding models can help in expanding sense-based vocabulary. Starting with a small set of seed words linked to five human senses—sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell—we used two popular embedding models, GloVe and FastText, to find new related words. The goal was to discover potential sense words from user reviews and then manually check if they truly express those senses. Our results show that FastText performed significantly better, identifying 65 new valid words, while GloVe identified 4. After removing duplicates, a total of 67 new sense words were added. This work highlights the usefulness of word embeddings in discovering meaning-based word associations and can support future work in areas like sentiment analysis, sense tagging, and contextual understanding.
